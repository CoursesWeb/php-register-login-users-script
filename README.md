 Short description:
 This script is created with the method based on classes and objects (OOP). It uses PHP 5.2+, MySQL and Ajax / JavaScript (with jQuery) [it can work also in browsers with JavaScript disabled]. The connection to MySQL is made with PDO. The HTML code is valid HTML5, also, works in Internet Explorer browsers which don't recognise HTML5 tags.
The Admin can delete users, modify their data, adds /delete messages and favorite links, and change their Rank, from -1 to 9.
The Rank -1 means banned, 0 is unconfirmed account, and a Rank 9 gives to the user Administration privileges.

Also, it has option to Log in with Facebook.
If the user forgot the name or the password, the script can send these data to his e-mail.
